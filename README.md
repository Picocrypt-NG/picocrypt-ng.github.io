Note: this repository hosts the web interface for Picocrypt in a server-like style for optimal performance and size, so there are multiple files to be loaded by the browser (you can't save an offline copy into a single file). You can clone this repository and serve it as a static site yourself by uploading the files to your own GitHub Pages, etc. or locally with something as simple as:
```
python -m http.server
```

Report any issues to the main Picocrypt/Picocrypt repository and prefix the title with 'Web:'.
